# ProgramRunner
This is a java program runner and also built in java, i made this for my personal use when i used to make java programs on notepad++, and it was a headache to type whole command again and again to compile and then run my java programs, so i made this console based runner which automatically enters compile and run command for your program, but you still need to type the name of program, it's still a hassale but it did help me a little,but now i use VSCode and other IDEs so not using this anymore

-Just put all these files in the folder where you save all your java programs and add a shortcut of batch(.bat) file to your homescreen
